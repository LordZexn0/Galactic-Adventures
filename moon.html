                            <h3>Sourcing Your Food <br></h3>
                                <p>Nourishment is just as important in space as it is on Earth. That's why we work with expert nutritionists 
                                    to source all the food necessary for your Lunar Tour experience. To accommodate the microgravity 
                                    environment, all food will be freeze-dried to avoid any potential contamination of the spacecraft's 
                                    electronics. Your water will be provided in bags, which you can drink using a straw.</p>

                                    At Galactic Adventures, we use only the most advanced and reliable vehicles for our space tourism trips. While our other packages, including planetary orbit, use a rocket ship design, the lunar exploration packages include a more advanced spacecraft designed exclusively for lunar travel. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our LM-120 space shuttle is equipped with the latest in spaceflight technology, including state-of-the-art life support systems, communication equipment, and navigation systems. The interior of the ship is designed to provide maximum comfort, with spacious cabins, private sleeping quarters, and ample storage space. It is specifically designed to accommodate travelers who want to go to the moon and even potentially to mars.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The engines of our rocket-ship are powered by cutting-edge propulsion technology, designed to deliver maximum 
                                    thrust and efficiency during all stages of flight. Our engines are engineered to withstand the extreme 
                                    conditions of space travel and provide the necessary power to reach our destination and return safely to Earth.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Continuing with the LM series, a feature of Lunar probes as well as rovers will accompany you on your galactic voyage. This includes the LM-870 automated probe which gives you live access to the lunar surface with a virtual interaction menu right from the comfort of the lunar base. The LM-2180 lunar rover is specially designed to roam the lunar surface. With its cutting-edge tire technology, it can handle the most rigid of lunar craters and hike the tallest of lunar peaks.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The last part of the LM series is an escape pod included in the space shuttle for safety escape. This pod seats up to 5 individuals and provides basic essentials and enough oxygen for a 2 day trip back to earth. To keep bulk down and allow this craft to be compact, it does not include all the comforts of a normal craft but enough to allow any visitors to survive and safely arrive back to earth.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Galactic Adventures is proud to work closely with two of the leading names in space exploration, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
                                    (JPL) and Boeing, to develop and operate our vehicles. Our collaboration with JPL and Boeing gives us access to the latest 
                                    spaceflight technology, research and engineering expertise, and a wealth of experience in interplanetary travel.

                                    Aboard the spacecraft, you will find an escape pod which will be able to hold as many people as on the flight so that in case of emergencies, people can safely get away from the dangers of the spacecraft. In the living spaces, there are also emergency rooms spaced out throughout the living space. We keep your safety in mind while designing your comfortable living spaces and vehicles

                                    The launch of the Lunar package offered by Galactic Adventures is a highly choreographed event that requires the coordination of many different teams and systems. Our experienced launch team works closely with organizations such as JPL and Boeing to ensure a smooth and safe launch. Going to the moon is no easy task, and we look forward to helping you get there in the best way possible  
                                </p>

                                    On launch day, the space shuttle will be fueled and undergo final checks before being transported to the launch pad. Our launch team will closely monitor the weather and make any necessary adjustments to the launch timeline to ensure the safety of all crew members. As it is a reusable spacecraft, this process can be done again similar to an airplane
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once the countdown reaches zero, the engines will ignite, propelling the vehicle into the sky. You will feel the g-forces as the space shuttle gains speed, and soon you will be on your way to the edge of space. The launch is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and you will never forget the thrill of leaving the Earth behind and venturing on your way to the moon and beyond as the shuttle, with all its might, takes you away from the night sky and to the moon.

                                    The recovery process for Galactic Adventures' Lunar exploratory package is an equally important aspect of your space journey. Our experienced recovery team works closely with JPL and Boeing to ensure a safe and smooth return to Earth.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After 10 days of travel on the moon, the vehicle will begin its descent back to the Earth Which will roughly take about 2 days. The engines will engage to slow the vehicle and guide it back to a predetermined landing site. Throughout the descent, the recovery team will closely monitor the vehicle and make any necessary adjustments to ensure a safe landing. In case of an emergency, the escape pods will be on standby. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since the shuttle carries large amounts of cargo, using the space shuttle design allows us to easily recover your shuttle as it has a designated runway for it to land on. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Upon landing, the vehicle will be recovered and the astronauts will undergo medical evaluations to ensure they are in good health after their journey. They will also undergo debriefing to discuss their experiences and provide valuable feedback to help improve future missions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The recovery process marks the end of an incredible adventure, but the memories and experiences gained from your journey will last a lifetime. Galactic Adventures is committed to ensuring a safe and memorable experience for all of our customers, and the recovery process is just one part of that commitment.
