                                    to source all the food necessary for your Planetary Orbit experience. To accommodate the microgravity 
                                    environment, all food will be freeze-dried to avoid any potential contamination of the spacecraft's 
                                    electronics. Your water will be provided in bags, which you can drink using a straw.</p>

                                    The launch of the Planetary Orbit package offered by Galactic Adventures is a highly choreographed event 
                                    that requires the coordination of many different teams and systems. Our experienced launch team works 
                                    closely with organizations such as JPL and Boeing to ensure a smooth and safe launch.

                                    On launch day, the vehicle will be fueled and undergo final checks before being transported to the launch 
                                    pad. Our launch team will closely monitor the weather and make any necessary adjustments to the launch 
                                    timeline to ensure the safety of all crew members.

                                    Once the countdown reaches zero, the engines will ignite, propelling the vehicle into the sky. You will 
                                    feel the g-forces as the vehicle gains speed, and soon you will be on your way to the edge of space. The 
                                    launch is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and you will never forget the thrill of leaving the Earth behind 
                                    and venturing into the great unknown.

                                    The recovery process for Galactic Adventures' Planetary Orbit package is an equally important aspect of your space journey. Our experienced recovery team works closely with JPL and Boeing to ensure a safe and smooth return to Earth.

                                    After 24 hours in orbit, the vehicle will begin its descent back to the Earth. The engines will engage to slow the vehicle and guide it back to a predetermined landing site. Throughout the descent, the recovery team will closely monitor the vehicle and make any necessary adjustments to ensure a safe landing.

                                    Upon landing, the vehicle will be recovered and the astronauts will undergo medical evaluations to ensure they are in good health after their journey. They will also undergo debriefing to discuss their experiences and provide valuable feedback to help improve future missions.
